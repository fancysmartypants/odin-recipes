# odin-recipes

This is the repository created for my recipe website. 

At the time of its creation, I am currently learning HTML. Through Odin Project, I have acquired some foundational HTML skills, such as the boilerplate, links and images, and working with text. 

This project showcase the HTML skills I have acquired thus far.
